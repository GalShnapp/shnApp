# shnApp
something along the lines of a bootstrap. I'm creating a repo with lots of useful place holders I know how to work with, so I can get a jump start on projects.

# app
is written with fast api

# db
is written with sqlalchemy and connects to a postgres DB. The schema is manged as code using alembic.
I'm currently using a local one, but I'm hoping to switch to a portable one with docker-compose soon.

# secret_store
is a private solution that enables me not to share my secrets :)
